# Path-Organizer

Ever had a messed up downloads folder? To tackle this problem this is a simple python script which takes Folder address as input and organizes all the files in the folder into separate folders based on the type of file. We can also add the same script on right click of mouse so that it automatically takes address on a right click->organize click and organizes the folder
